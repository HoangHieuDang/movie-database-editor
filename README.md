# Film Project Part 1 (Regular pace program)

## Description
I just switched from fast pace coding program back to regular pace program offered by Masterschool.

With that being said, this program is an extended version of the code I originally wrote for the same coding assignment titled "Movie Project - Phase 1 - Fast Track". The assignment i did was designed slightly differently compared to this current assignment, since it was made for the fast-paced program from Masterschool.

As a result, this code includes features that are not required for this particular assignment compared to the one designed for the fast-paced program. Nevertheless, the program will be further extended to fulfill the additional bonus assignment, incorporating a Histogram and Fuzzy Search feature.
